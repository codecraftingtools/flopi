warning, and error information. Flopi can operate as a pure Python
module, or in conjunction with Flout when extending or embedding the
Python interpreter.

`Flopi`_ is part of the `Code Craftsmen`_ project.  The
`documentation`_ is hosted on `Read the Docs`_ and the `source code`_
can be found on `GitHub`_.
